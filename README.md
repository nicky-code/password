## Description
This project was generated with PYTHON version 3.6
I also install the pyperclip with this command python3.6 -m pip install pyperclip to illustrates how to download a third party module.

## Development Server
Run python3.6 in Terminal to see the code and remember to add the file after it and see your test.

## Code scaffolding
Run run.py when you want to implement the features we have just have been testing.

## Running unittests
Run python3.6 plus test file where you are adding the test function.

## BDD
### Behaviour
We want our application to:

1. Allow us to Create user and credentials with properties.

2. Save user and credentials.

3. Display credentials.

4. Delete credentials.

5. Display user information.

# Password Locker Application
## Password Locker Application, 8th of September 2019
### By Aline Nicole UWAMARIYA
## Description
This project was generated with PYTHON version 3.6
I also install the pyperclip with this command python3.6 -m pip install pyperclip to illustrates how to download a third party module.

## Development Server
Run python3.6 in Terminal to see the code and remember to add the file after it and see your test.

## Code scaffolding
Run run.py when you want to implement the features we have just have been testing.

## Running unittests
Run python3.6 plus test file where you are adding the test function.

## BDD
### Behaviour
We want our application to:

1. Allow us to Create user and credentials with properties.
2. Save user and credentials.
3. Display credentials.
4. Delete credentials.
5. Display user information.
6. As a user, I would like to be able to copy my credentials to the clipboard.
7. As a user, I would also like to dictate the length of the password I generate.

## Input Examples
as a user will be able to log in :
1. username
2. email address
3. password

then add the credentials as well, we will be able to sign in:
1.accountName
2.siteName
3.username
4.email
5.password

## Output Examples
the user will be able to see all the informations inputed after displaying them.

## TDD

3.A user should be able to login to their account using the password that they created and NOT any password.
4.Your project should make use of docstrings to document methods and functions.
5.Your project must have a test class that test each individual method in your classes.
6.Your project should contain a proper detailed README markdown file, with the full description of the project, setup instructions, dependencies, technologies used, authors, license information and contact information.
